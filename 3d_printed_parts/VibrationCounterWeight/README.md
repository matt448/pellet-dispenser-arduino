##Description
This is a 3D printed counter weight that is to be used with a small DC hobby motor with a 2mm shaft. The counter weight clamps onto the shaft of the motor. It was designed to use a 4-40 x 0.5" screw but an M3x10mm screw should also work. 

This counter weight in combination with a DC hobby motor is designed to be used in a vibrating tray style dispenser.
